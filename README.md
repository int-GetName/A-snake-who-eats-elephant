# A-snake-who-eats-elephantï¼ˆThe code is currently incomplete)
The millstone for every c/c++ learner may be to construct a snake game running in console, and this is my one.
This code was originally developed on MxLinux with ncurses. 
When you compile the code, you should append "-lncurses" at the end of your command line. For example,"g++ a.cpp b.cpp -lncurses".
